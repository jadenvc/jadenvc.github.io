<br/><img src='/images/med.png'>

At [Hands-On Robotics](https://handsonrobotics.org/) we are collaborating with the Stanford Children's Hospital to explore how quadrupeds can improve peri-operative and inpatient pediatric experience. Our work has been featured in the [Stanford Report](https://news.stanford.edu/report/2023/08/01/robo-dogs-unleash-fun-joy-stanford-hospital/), [ABC News]([https://news.stanford.edu/report/2023/08/01/robo-dogs-unleash-fun-joy-stanford-hospital/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53UHRF8ns1I&ab_channel=StuartBowers)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53UHRF8ns1I&ab_channel=StuartBowers), and more."
