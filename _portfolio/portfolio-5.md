title: "Previous: Online Re-planning for UAVs"
excerpt: "Developed a new path repair algorithm GRIT (Greedy Repair Initializes Tabu search) for handling failures in multi-robot aerial surveys. GRIT outperforms path repair for nominal paths planned with both a traditional lawnmower-style planner and a more sophisticated integer program based planner, achieving adequate re-plans 10-50 times faster than two benchmark planners, making it ideal for online path repair in mid-flight.
