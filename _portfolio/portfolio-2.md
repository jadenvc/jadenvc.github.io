title: "DeepShark"
excerpt: "I initiated an international collaboration between Stanford Student Robotics and Universidad de Costa Rica to automate analysis of drone imagery of sharks, rays, and turtles. We developed a pipeline to automatically detect large marine animals and compute key biometrics such as shark length, width, mass, and age. We were sponsored by the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and Parrot to lead a team of Stanford Students on a field mission to survey Santa Elena Bay, Costa Rica to survey endangered species (Pacific Nurse Sharks, Olive Ridley Turtles) and habitat (mangroves, reefs).
