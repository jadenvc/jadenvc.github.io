title: "UAVs for Penguin Monitoring"
excerpt: "Developed new methods for oordinating multi-robot aerial surveys for studying Adelie Penguins in Cape Crozier, Antarctica. GRIT (Greedy Repair Initializes Tabu search) outperforms path repair for nominal paths planned with both a traditional lawnmower-style planner and a more sophisticated integer program based planner, achieving adequate re-plans 10-50 times faster than two benchmark planners, making it ideal for online path repair in mid-flight.
