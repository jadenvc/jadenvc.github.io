title: "Characterizing Key White Shark Habitat"
excerpt: "White sharks are known to migrate across the Pacific Ocean to the lee of Hawaiâ€™i Island in the spring and early summer. Yet, little is known about why white sharks perform this migration and how key oceanographic features like eddies and seamounts affect their behavior. I worked with researchers at the Stanford Hopkins Marine Station to analyze novel white shark Pop-up Satellite Tag (PSAT) data tracking and performed in-situ sampling of oceanography in the region. Our results suggest that the core of anticyclonic eddies, peripheries of cyclonic eddies, and seamounts are structuring vibrant mesopelagic communities in the area, attracting white sharks in a similar way to the well-known White Shark Cafe. <br/><img src='/images/ws_hawaii.png'>"
