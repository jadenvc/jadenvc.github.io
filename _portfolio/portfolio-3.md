title: "Game Theoretic Planning"
excerpt: "Road vehicles must operate in a complex, non-cooperative multi-agent systems. Game theoretic planners - which typically encode the planning problem as a dynamic multi-agent game and solve for a Nash or Stackelburg equilibrium, have been shown to improve on traditional planners in several challenging scenarios, such as lane merging. However, an important assumption that many methods currently make is knowledge of the objective function of opponents. In this work, we relax this assumption. We developed a pipeline to learn a terminal value function online for a game theoretic planner. Our method improves performance of the solver in both lane merging and overtaking scenarios. Now, we are extending this scheme to dynamically estimate objectives of other agents online. <br/><img src='/images/gtp.png'>"
