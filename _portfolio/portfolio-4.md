title: "DeepShark"
excerpt: "Initiated collaboration between Stanford Student Robotics and Universidad de Costa Rica to automate analysis of drone imagery of sharks, rays, and turtles. Led a team of Stanford Students on a field mission to survey Santa Elena Bay, Costa Rica to survey endangered species (Pacific Nurse Sharks, Olive Ridley Turtles) and habitat (mangroves, reefs). We have since released several papers and are developing novel camera tags to study endangered marine animals from underwater (planned deployment summer 2025).
