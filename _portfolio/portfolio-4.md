title: "UAVs for Penguin Monitoring"
excerpt: "I worked on coordinating multi-robot aerial surveys for studying Adelie Penguins in Cape Crozier, Antarctica. I developed a new path repair algorithm GRIT (Greedy Repair Initializes Tabu search) for handling failures in multi-robot aerial surveys. GRIT outperforms path repair for nominal paths planned with both a traditional lawnmower-style planner and a more sophisticated integer program based planner, achieving adequate re-plans 10-50 times faster than two benchmark planners, making it ideal for online path repair in mid-flight.
