I am an undergraduate studying AI and robotics at Stanford. I work on Multi-Agent motion planning in the [Stanford Multi-Robot Systems Lab (MSL)](https://msl.stanford.edu/) with [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/) and develop agile quadrupeds with [Dr. Karen Liu](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/karen-liu). I have also worked on animal conservation and zoology - using computational tools from robotics and AI to study animal behavior. I previously studied movement ecology of large marine animals with [Dr. Barbara Block](https://www.stanfordblocklab.org/) at Stanford, and flight biomechanics with [Dr. Tim Higham](https://biomechanics.ucr.edu/) at UC Riverside.
