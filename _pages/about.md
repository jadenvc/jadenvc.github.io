I am a first year PhD student in AI and robotics at Stanford supported by the [Knight-Hennessy Fellowship](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/) and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I previously completed my undergrad at Stanford where I worked with [Dr. Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/), [Dr. Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/), and [Dr. Karen Liu](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/karen-liu). My primary research interests are in learning for decision making and robotics.

I am also excited about using computational tools from robotics and AI to aid wildlife conservation and research. I curently collaborate most closely with [Dr. Mario Espinoza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario-Espinoza-3) at Universidad de Costa Rica to develop low cost technology to study and conserve marine animals. I previously worked at [MBARI](https://www.mbari.org/) developing new algorithms for agile underwater vehicles, studied movement ecology of large marine animals with [Dr. Barbara Block](https://www.stanfordblocklab.org/) at Stanford, and flight biomechanics with [Dr. Tim Higham](https://biomechanics.ucr.edu/) at UC Riverside.
