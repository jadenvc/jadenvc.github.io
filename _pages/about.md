I am a Masters Student in AI and robotics at Stanford and am advised by [Dr. Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/) and [Dr. Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/). I work on agile quadrupeds with [Dr. Karen Liu](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/karen-liu) and the team at [Hands-On Robotics](https://handsonrobotics.org/about-us). My primary resesearch interests are in learning for decision making and robotics.

I am also excited about using computational tools from robotics and AI to study animal behavior and collaborate heavily with [Dr. Mario Espinoza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario-Espinoza-3) at Universidad de Costa Rica. I previously studied movement ecology of large marine animals with [Dr. Barbara Block](https://www.stanfordblocklab.org/) at Stanford, and flight biomechanics with [Dr. Tim Higham](https://biomechanics.ucr.edu/) at UC Riverside.
